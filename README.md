Step 1 (HTML Code):
To get started, we will first need to create a basic HTML file. In this file, we will include the main structure for our ice cream shop landing page.
After creating the files just paste the following below codes into your file. Make sure to save your HTML document with a .html extension, so that it can be properly viewed in a web browser.

Step 2 (CSS Code):

Once the basic HTML structure of the ice cream shop landing page is in place, the next step is to add styling to the ice cream shop landing page using CSS. CSS allows us to control the visual appearance of the website, including things like layout, color, and typography.
Next, use CSS to style the entire ice cream shop landing page. This will give it a look and feel that is unique to your business. You can also use CSS to add animations and effects to your page.

Step 3 (JavaScript Code):

Finally, use JavaScript to add interactivity and functionality to your ice cream shop landing page. This can include pop-ups, countdown timers, and more.
By using these three languages together, you can create an amazing ice cream shop landing page that will impress your customers!
